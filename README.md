This project is just like scratching the surface of the vast field of search engine architecture. It is in no way intended to be deployed for commercial use. Interested people can utilize this project to get an insight into how a search engine can be contructed from scratch.

Thanks to Toby Segaran for his huge work in Programming Collective Intelligence. I have gained immensely from his lucid and in-depth illustrations of different machine learning topics.
